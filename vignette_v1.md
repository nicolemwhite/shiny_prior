## About ShinyPrior

ShinyPrior is an web-based application for estimating probability distributions based on summary statistics. The application was originally developed to help characterise uncertainty in model inputs, as part of health economic evaluation. Available options focus on common two-parameter distributions for continuous variables.

$$\alpha = x\beta$$


### Define distribution inputs

* Distributions: continuous, two-parameter
* Evidence types depending on distribution
* Estimation methods - Moment matching, Numerical optimisation (sum of squared differences between expected and observed percentiles) 
* Error messages

### Customisation

Options to customise the presentation of estimated probability distributions can be found unde the Customisation tab. Outputs can be summarised as density plots or summary tables. Results can be summarised for a single or multiple distributions.

### Visualisation

By default, density curves for the current distribution are presented in the visualisation window. When displaying multiple distribution, the legend follows the order in which distribution names are entered into the "Select distribution(s) to plot" box.
