## About ShinyPrior

ShinyPrior is an web-based application for estimating probability distributions based on summary statistics. The application was originally developed to help characterise uncertainty in model inputs, as part of health economic evaluation. Available options focus on common two-parameter distributions for continuous variables.


### Define distribution inputs

* Distributions: continuous, two-parameter
* Evidence types depending on distribution
* Estimation methods - Moment matching, Numerical optimisation (sum of squared differences between expected and observed percentiles) 
* Error messages

### Customisation

* Visualisation options
* Summary table options
* Removing results

### Troubleshooting

### Citation information
